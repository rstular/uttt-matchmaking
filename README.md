# UTTT Matchmaking

A sample implementation for Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe matchmaking server. The code for UTTT client is private at the moment, as making it public would be considered academic fraud (the project was done as a part of the CSE1400 course of TU Delft).

*Please note: this is a "quick and dirty" implementation - it was written in less than 12 hours, so it most likely contains bugs, as well as vulnerabilities (for example, it is trivial to DoS the server). I may fix the security issues at some point in the future, when I have the time (and will) to do so.*
